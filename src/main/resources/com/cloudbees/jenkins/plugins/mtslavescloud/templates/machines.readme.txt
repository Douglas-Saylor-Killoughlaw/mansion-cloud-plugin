This JSON file defines available built-in slave templates. These slave templates
will be always forced upon users (except they can disable them), and users will not
be able to change the configuration of them.

See BuiltinSlaveTemplate that matches this.

For user-modifiable slave templates, there are other subtypes of SlaveTemplate available.
