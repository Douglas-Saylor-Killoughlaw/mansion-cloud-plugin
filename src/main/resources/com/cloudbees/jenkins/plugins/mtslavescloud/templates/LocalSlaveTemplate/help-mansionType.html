<div>
    Specify the type of the mansion that will host this template.

    Different mansion type virtualizes slaves very differently, and so you need to specify the correct one
    based on your slave OS.

    Most of the time, you create a custom slave template by deriving from an existing slave template.
    In such a case, use the same mansion type as the base template.

    <p>
    As of this writing, two mansion types are supported: "lxc" for Linux and "osx" for Mac OS X.
